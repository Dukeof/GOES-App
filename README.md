# Internal guidelines for the "Goes-App"


## This is our final project. It will be a lot of work. There will be moments of frustration, for all of us.
## 

## Some ground rules


- we're being respectful to eachother.
- we don't hold back on our ideas. Be vocal. All opinions and Ideas are valid!
- we all make suggestions and explain our points but desicions that impact all of us (packeges, tools, struckures, global variables, etc.) will be made as a team.
- let's keep the project structure open and agile, that way we can deal better with changes (THEY WILL COME UP!) and the application will be more scaleable in the future.



## Dividing tasks


- we use the ticketsystem to clearly say what we are working on. 
- we strictly avoid for two developers to work on the same file at the same time.
- if we e.g. see the need for a new GLOBAL container, we write a short message, decide who will do it, and once it's done, push it and let everyone know the changes
  are there to pull. 


## GIT

- commit a lot.
- Do not work on local Master branch.
- add  and commit before every other type of git-action. 
- Do not merge into remote-Master. Only Dusko and Mario merge into Master. 
- make another commit. it doesn't hurt.
- always be in the root-directory when working on git-actions.
- did I mention that it's important to commit a lot? 
- always pull the development branch, merge locally, resolve possible convlicts locally and then push. 
- commit more.
