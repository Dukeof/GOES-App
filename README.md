# GOES-App

GOES-App is part of a citizen science platform aimed at building a dataset of global plankton popultations.
The app is used to annotate microscopic images, identifying and counting which Phytoplankton and Zooplankton
are present in samples collected along coastlines or at sea. The results of the annotations are uploaded to a data set,
which is used to monitor global plankton populations.

More information about the project can be found at [The GOES Foundation](https://www.goesfoundation.com)
